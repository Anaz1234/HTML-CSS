In 2017, the Mumbai Indians became the first franchise to cross the $100 million mark in brand value 
among the IPL franchises.[3] The brand value of Mumbai Indians, in 2019, is estimated to be around â‚¹809
 crore (roughly $115 million), the highest among all the IPL franchises for the fourth consecutive year.[4]

Mumbai Indians won the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 after beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 31 runs
 in the final. The team won the double by winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating Chennai Super
  Kings by 23 runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 33 runs to win its second Champions
   League Twenty20 title later that year.[5][6] They won their second IPL title on 24 May 2015 by defeating

<p id="aboutSrh">
   <mark> ABOUT Sunrisers Hyderabad Indians TEAM:</mark>  Sunrisers Hyderabad (stylised as SunRisers Hyderabad, abbr. SRH) are a professional franchise
     cricket team based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL).
     [4] The franchise is owned by Kalanithi Maran of the SUN Group and was founded in 2012 after the
      Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were terminated by the IPL.[5] The team is currently coached by 
      Daniel Vettori and captained by Pat Cummins. Their primary home ground is the Rajiv Gandhi International
       Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, which has a capacity of 39,000.[6]

The team made their first IPL appearance in 2013, where they reached the playoffs, eventually 
finishing in fourth place. The Sunrisers won their maiden IPL title in the 2016 season, defeating 
the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 8 runs in the final. The team has qualified for the play-off stage
 of the tournament for five consecutive seasons between 2016 and 2020. In 2018, the team reached the
  finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Chennai Super Kings. In 2024, the team reached the
   finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. The team was considered one
    of the best bowling sides, often admired for its ability to defend low totals, but now has shifted 
    to a remarkable batting side, according to many cricket pundits. The team also holds the record for
     the highest-ever IPL total with 287 runs.[7] David Warner is the leading run scorer for the side,

     wicket-taker having won the Purple Cap twice, in 2016 and 2017.[9][10] The COVID-19 pandemic impacted 
     the brand value of the Sunrisers Hyderabad which saw a decline of 4 percent to US$57.4 million in 2020
      as the overall brand value of the IPL decreased to US$4.4 billion, according to Brand Finance.[11]
