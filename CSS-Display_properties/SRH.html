        India medium-pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been one of the leading wicket-takers for the Sunrisers 
        Hyderabad. Quite expectedly, he has also been the leader of the SRH pace attack in the past and
         will be one of the bowling mainstays for the franchise. Bhuvneshwar has a massive haul of 142
          wickets that includes best bowling figures of 5/19 that he took in 2017 against Kings XI Punjab
           (now Punjab Kings). With exceptional control on line and length and swing bowling, Bhuvneshwar
            is one of the top threats for opening batsmen across the circuit.

            The left-arm medium-pacer from Tamil Nadu is known for his bowling abilities in the domestic T20
             circuit wherein he has sprung up match-winning performances for Tamil Nadu. It came as a pleasant 
             surprise when he was the highest-paid uncapped Indian player, picked up by Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings)
              in 2017. He played 6 games for the franchise but had just 2 wickets to his name. In the 2020 IPL edition though,
               Natarajan put up a breakthrough performance picking up 16 wickets in 16 games. His bowling abilities earned him a 
               T20I & ODI call-up in Australia and was soon drafted into the Test fold as well in 2021. He played just 2 games in 
               the 2021 IPL and missed the rest of the season due to an injury. In 2022, Natarajan will be looking to get back to his
                old wicket-taking self when he walks out in orange for the Sunrisers Hyderabad.

        Abhishek Sharma first came into the limelight with a century on Under-19 debut for Punjab
         in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. He led India to victory in the U-19 Asia Cup in 2016 and was an
          integral part of the 2018 U19 World Cup. A hard-hitting lower order batsman who can also bowl left-arm
           spin, Sharma was brought by the Delhi Daredevils (now known as Delhi Capitals) in 2018. He played just 
           3 games with very little to show and was roped in by the Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2019. In 2020, he played 8 
           games but did not have the best of numbers to his name. This year too he will feature for the orange army.

        Rahul Tripathi over the years has been making waves with his hard-hitting skills. In his debut 
        season in 2017 with Rising Pune Supergiant, he pummelled the bowlers to make his presence felt 
        in the IPL. He slammed a highest of 93 as he gathered 391 runs from 12 matches. He played for 
        the Rajasthan Royals in 2018 and 2019 but did not have the best of seasons. He was traded in the KKR line-up 
        after being brought in the 2020 IPL Auction for INR 60 lakhs. Since then he has been KKRâ€™s go-to man in the 
        top-order scoring 397 runs in the 2021 IPL season. He will be looking to transpire similar performances for 
        Sunrisers Hyderabad going forward.
