    MS Dhoni added another feather to his cap in 2021 edition of the league as CSK won 
    their fourth title. Ahead of the 2022 edition of the league, MS Dhoni was one of the four 
    retained players by the franchise and he was retained for a sum of INR 12 crore. A batting powerhouse,
     MS Dhoni possesses the ability to destroy different bowling attacks on his own. The calmness and composure 
     in his demeanor along with a sharp cricketing brain accounts for a lethal combination on the cricketing
      field and the glistening silverware in the trophy cabinets at CSK are a testimony to his extraordinary
       leadership skills. He was the face of Chennai Super Kings for the first eight editions of the league,
        leading them to two titles (2010 & 2011) and four runner-up finishes. He then became the first player
         to be drafted by Rising Pune Supergiant in the ninth edition of the league. And, he once again became
          the first player to be retained by CSK ahead of the IPL Player Auction 2018. The 2018 season of the 
          league had a fairytale ending with another glistening silverware added to the trophy cabinet of the 
          Chennai Super Kings. The 2019 edition of the league too saw the CSK reach the finals of the tournament 
          under MS Dhoni’s leadership. While MS Dhoni has hung up his boots on a 16-year illustrious career
        for Team India, he was seen donning the CSK colours once again in 2020.

    16 matches, 635 runs and high score of 101* in the 2021 edition of the league, Ruturaj Gaikwad 
    was retained by the CSK ahead of the 2022 edition of the league for INR 6 crore. The opening batter
     who hails from Pune, Ruturaj Gaikwad has been a consistent performer for his state team Maharashtra. 
     He was the highest run-getter for Maharashtra in the league stage of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2018-19.
      At the IPL 2019 Player Auction, the Chennai Super Kings secured his services at his base price of INR 20 lacs. 
      He has been their most consistent opener and will look to do the same come April and May.

    Jadeja’s love affair with runs and wickets continued at IPL 2021 and he was the highest paid retention for CSK 
    ahead of the 2022 edition of the league. The outstanding all-rounder was retained for INR 16 crore.
     Earlier, he became the third retained player by CSK ahead of the IPL 2018 Player Auction. Ravindra 
     Jadeja has always been MS Dhoni’s go-to-man when he needed to break a partnership and the left-armer
      has delivered the goods on many occasions. His presence gives Dhoni the extra cushion of playing an 
      additional batsman if needed. Jadeja has been an enigma right since his advent in international cricket. 
      He was part of the victorious Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. 
      His performance in IPL 2008 helped Rajasthan Royals to title victory and earned him the nickname 
      "Rockstar" by his captain Shane Warne. In 2012 IPL player auction, Jadeja was bought by Chennai 
      Super Kings for approx. Rs. 9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player of the year's auction.
       Jadeja has represented the Gujarat Lions for two seasons and was back with CSK for the eleventh edition
        of the league. He has been an integral part of them ever since.

    Ajinkya Rahane’s credentials as a batter is well known. An experienced campaigner who has played for
     Mumbai, India and various IPL franchises in the past, Rahane will be turning up for the Chennai Super
      Kings this year. Rahane has been a prolific run-scorer at the top-order in the past and he could well 
      be the perfect foil for aggressive opening partners. A senior member who brings in with him a wealth
       of experience, it will be interesting to see how CSK use him in their batting line-up.
