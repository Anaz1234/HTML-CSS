    Captain Marvellous. Rohit Sharma has etched his name as the most successful captain in the IPL with five trophies, the most
     by anyone in the tournament. He has cracked the code and made MI the most consistent team. A prolific 
     run-getter, the Hitman is one of the most naturally gifted batsmen in the world and has been enjoying a
      tremendous run with the bat. When it comes to the shorter format, there are few who can match his 
      striking abilities. Rohit proved why he is regarded as a special talent when he became the first 
      batsman to strike two double centuries in the ODIs and he now has three. He was one of the most
       consistent Deccan Chargers batsmen in the first three seasons of the IPL and was instrumental 
       in his former franchise winning the crown in 2009 However, since 2011, Rohit has been an integral 
       part of the Mumbai Indians guiding their batting line-up. He took over the team’s captaincy a couple
        of games into the 2013 season and led MI to their maiden IPL title. In the same year, MI also 
        completed a grand double when they clinched the Champions League T20 title. His captaincy was 
        put to test in the 2015 season after the team won just one of their first six games and were 
        struggling to stay afloat. Mumbai Indians then staged a remarkable turnaround and lifted the
         Trophy for the second time with a convincing win in the final. Rohit, who made a half-century, 
         was named the Player of the Match. The legacy of Hitman expanded further on, after powering 
         Mumbai Indians to title victories in the 2017 and 2019 seasons, both being last ball thrillers. 
         Rohit led the Mumbai Indians to a successful campaign in the 2020 season, which was their second 
         consecutive title. MI did not qualify for playoffs in the 14th season and will be raring to go this 
         time. He now returns as Team India’s full-time captain in all three formats of the game.

   <center><h3 style="color: blue;">Suryakumar Yadav </h3></center>
   <h3 style="color:black;"><ins><b>ABOUT: </b></ins></h3>
   <p>
    Consistent performances year after year has helped Suryakumar Yadav establish himself
     as one of India’s premium white-ball batsmen. He has made a splash ever since he returned to 
     Mumbai Indians for the 11th season of the IPL. Bought for INR 3.2 crore, the Mumbai batsman 
     used his ample knowledge of the Wankhede Stadium pitch and made full use of the opportunities
      given to him. In a season where they failed to qualify for the playoffs, Suryakumar shone with 
      his performances at the top of the order. Asked to open the batting, Suryakumar excelled in his
       role and scored over 500 runs in 2018, including four fifties. Used as a middle-order by Kolkata
        Knight Riders, Suryakumar’s new role with MI was a game-changer. Facing the new ball, he has 
        looked at ease and handled the situation well. Playing as per the situation, Suryakumar was
         able to change gears and even played patiently when the situation demanded. In 2019, he amassed
          424 runs to be MI’s second-highest run-getter. He outperformed himself in the 2020 season scoring
           480 runs at a strike rate of 145 and went on to make his T20 International debut later for India. 
           It wasn’t a surprise for anyone when he smashed the deliveries right from ball one and scored an
            magnificent fifty that resembled confidence. Just how much he is valued by MI was proved ahead 
            of the auction when he was retained by the franchise. Much of MI’s success this season will depend
             on how Suryakumar goes about his business.

<h3 style="color:black;"><ins><b>ABOUT: </b></ins></h3>
<p>
    Pandya played for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL from 2015 to 2021.[9][10] Against the Kolkata 
    Knight Riders, in a must-win match for Mumbai Indians to remain in the playoff race, he scored 
    61 runs off 31 balls to take the match, earning him his second man of the match award of the season.[11]

    Ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction, Pandya was released by the Mumbai Indians. He was then drafted by 
    the new Ahmedabad franchise, Gujarat Titans, and named captain of the team.[12][13] He led Gujarat
     to their maiden IPL title in 2022, becoming the first captain after Shane Warne to lead a team to 
     the title in its first year.[14] In the IPL 2023 Pandya again led Gujarat Titans to the finals but
      lost to Chennai Super Kings by five wickets through DLS method.

<center><h3  style="color: blue;">Jasprit Bumrah </h3></center>
<h3 style="color:black;"><ins><b>ABOUT: </b></ins></h3>
<p>
    No other cricketer has made as much progress as this man with an unorthodox action. 
    Breaking all myths and stereotypes, Jasprit Bumrah has emerged as India’s No. 1 bowler 
    across all formats. His transition from white-ball cricket to red ball has been seamless
     and he now has five-wicket hauls in South Africa, England and Australia. His stocks continue to 
     rise and he has now been elevated to the position of vice-captain of India’s Test team. It has been
      a tremendous journey for Bumrah, who started off the IPL with Virat Kohli as his maiden wicket. 
      Bowling alongside Lasith Malinga helped him initially and the Sri Lankan star has backed his strength
       and boosted his confidence. Credit must go this lethal speedster who has always looked to get better
        in all three formats of the game. Facing him has always been a struggle and it won’t be any easy this
         time around too as he is riding high on confidence with a spirited five-wicket haul on the Bengaluru 
         track that assisted the spinners.
